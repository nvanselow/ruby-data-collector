# ruby-data-collector
A simple data collection app with Ruby (console version). This projected has
also been completed using javascript (and jQuery) in the "javascript_version"
folder. Navigate to the "javascript_version" folder and run `ruby app.rb` to start
the Sinatra server. After the server is running, visit [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) to test out the app in a browser.

See more on this project at the [multi-part code review](http://blog.nickvanselow.com/ruby-data-collection-tutorial) on my blog.
